A plugin for [ImageJ](http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/)/[Fiji](http://fiji.sc/) for Synchronous Viewer for Efficient Analysis of Biomedical Applications.

Biomedical research often involves a heavy data analysis of comparing different volume stacks from the sample. Identifying temporal changes of the sample in a longitudinal study or comparing different contrast that complements one another are examples of such procedures, where a synchronous visualizaFon tool is essenFal for efficient analysis of three dimensional datasets.
